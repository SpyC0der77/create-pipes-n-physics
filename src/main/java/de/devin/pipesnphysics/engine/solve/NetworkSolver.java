/**
 * Pure hydraulic network solver. Has no Minecraft dependencies so it can be
 * unit-tested directly.
 *
 * The network is modeled as an electrical-circuit analogue:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Nodes</b> carry a hydraulic head (fluid surface height, in blocks).
 *       Nodes with positive capacitance are reservoirs (tanks/basins): capacitance
 *       is the volume in mB needed to raise their head by one block. Nodes with
 *       zero capacitance are junctions or pumps — pure Kirchhoff nodes whose head
 *       is solved from flow conservation.</li>
 *   <li><b>Branches</b> are pipe runs: a conductance (mB/tick of flow per block of
 *       head difference), an optional EMF (a pump's head boost, in blocks, driving
 *       a→b when positive), an optional one-way constraint (check valve), and an
 *       optional crest gate (the highest cell of the run; flow is cut when the
 *       interpolated head at the crest falls more than the suction limit below it —
 *       the siphon/cavitation rule).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * One call advances the network by one tick using an <b>implicit Euler</b> step:
 * the linear system {@code (C/dt + L) h' = (C/dt) h + emf terms} is solved for the
 * end-of-tick heads, and branch flows are read off the solved heads. Implicit Euler
 * is unconditionally stable: reservoir heads converge monotonically toward
 * equilibrium and can never overshoot or oscillate, regardless of conductance,
 * capacitance, or tick length. This is the property that makes tank equalization
 * settle instead of sloshing forever.
 *
 * One-way and crest constraints are enforced with an active-set loop: solve, drop
 * every branch whose solved flow violates a constraint, re-solve. Each iteration
 * only removes branches, so the loop terminates in at most |branches| rounds.
