/**
 * Learns, from behaviour alone, which fluid-handler blocks are RELAYS rather than passive tanks, so
 * the engine stops equalizing them as reservoirs (see CLAUDE.md §2 and {@link HandlerRoles}).
 *
 * The discriminator is spontaneous GAIN. A real capacitor's stored amount only moves by the transfers
 * WE apply; a consumer (a basin, a boiler) spontaneously LOSES fluid to its own recipe; only a relay
 * (a docking connector, a hose, a passthrough) spontaneously GAINS fluid, because it is sourcing from
 * a pair or cascade the engine does not model. A block TYPE observed gaining fluid on its own — with
 * no fill from us — on {@link #STRIKES_TO_DEMOTE} separate ticks is demoted to a relay for the rest of
 * the session; a spontaneous loss (a consumer) forgives a strike.
 *
 * Keying by block TYPE means learning one instance generalizes to a whole mod's block with no
 * hardcoded id. Create's own tanks/basins are exempt: one legitimately fed by a SECOND network from
 * another side would otherwise read as an external gain. The learned set is memory-only and re-learns
 * cheaply after a restart; a false positive is recoverable with the is_reservoir tag.
